                        <h2>Why Should I Eat More Vegetables?</h2>
                        <p>Vegetables are good for you. It really is quite a simple argument. If you eat good things your life in likely to have goodness and health. Most vegetables have vitamins and minerals that our bodies need and often don't get enough of. If you change your eating habits to bring more of these vitamins and minerals into your body daily then your body will be happy and will be healthy. There are many who argue that vegetables can heal and prevent disease or illness, which is true in some cases. I argue the overall benefit of eating more vegetables, if you eat them you will feel better (unless you are allergic, then obviously, that statement does not work for you). Improved health will come with a diet that includes vegetables to give you the energy and nutrients you need. Try it for yourself, significantly increase your vegetables in your daily diet. Do it for over a week and see if you feel a difference. Do some research and see for yourself the many benefits that await you when you eat your vegetables.</p>

                        <h2>Processed vs. Organic Vegetables</h2>
                        <p>This question has been looked at time and time again. Often it is a general question of which is better, organic food or processed food. I would think that the answer to this question is often the same. Organic is better. Organic is defined as "derived from living matter" and processed means "mechanical or chemical operations have been performed on something in order to change or preserve it." Organic is pure and processed is changed. I am under the opinion that un-organic vegetables are better than no vegetables at all. Decide for yourself what you expect out of the food you eat and determine if purchasing organic is worth it to you. You can still make wise choices when it comes to processed foods. Research and be aware of what you are purchasing. Make wise decisions of what you eat regardless if it is organic or not. And eat more vegetables because they are good for you. </p>

                        <h2>Growing Your Own Vegetables</h2>
                        <p>When you learn about the individual <a href="/veggies/veggies.php">veggies</a> you will see links to outside sites that give step-by-step directions on how to grow the vegetables for yourself. Growing your own vegetables can be fun and very rewarding. To be able to go and pick vegetables from your garden, or even growing something small on the window sill you can have delicious food right at your finger tips. Growing your own also gives you that chance to get the family unified, working on something together. Having a garden can be fun and beneficial, but thankfully a grocery store helps a lot too!</p>
